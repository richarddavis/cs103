\begin{enumerate}
\item[i. ] We can create a TM $M$ that accepts an arbitrary string $w$ and loops infinitely on all other inputs. $M$ is constructed such that $\mathscr{L}(M)$ = \{$w$\}. Because $M$ does not halt on all inputs, $M$ is not a decider. 

We can create a second TM $N$ that accepts the string $w$ and rejects all other inputs. The language of $N$ is $\mathscr{L}(N)$ = \{$w$\}. Since $N$ halts on all inputs, $N$ is a decider. By definition, a language L is called decidable if there is a decider N such that $\mathscr{L}(N)$ = L, so $\mathscr{L}(N)$ is decidable. 

Because we defined $\mathscr{L}(M) = \mathscr{L}(N) = \{$w$\}$, we know that $\mathscr{L}(M)$ is must be decidable. Thus, we have described a TM $M$ where $\mathscr{L}(M) \in \textbf{R}$, but $M$ is not a decider.

\item[ii. ] 
\begin{thm} For every string $w$, there's an \textbf{R} and an \textbf{RE} language containing $w$.\end{thm}
\begin{proof} Take the second TM, $N$, described in part i of this problem. For any arbitrary string $w$, $N$ accepts $w$ and rejects all other inputs. $N$ halts on all inputs, so $N$ is a decider. This means that $\mathscr{L}(N) \in \textbf{R}$. 

We also know that $\textbf{R} \subseteq \textbf{RE}$, and by definition of a subset, all elements of $\textbf{R}$ are also elements of $\textbf{RE}$. As such, we know that $\mathscr{L}(N) \in \textbf{RE}$. Thus, we have shown that for every string $w$, there exists an \textbf{R} and an \textbf{RE} language containing $w$.

\section*{Problem 7}

Consider the program:
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont

\hspace*{10 mm} int main() \{\\
\hspace*{20 mm} string me = mySource();\\
\hspace*{20 mm} string input = getInput();\\
\hspace*{20 mm} if (willAccept(me, input)) \{\\
\hspace*{30 mm} reject();\\
\hspace*{20 mm} \} else \{\\
\hspace*{30 mm} accept();\\
\hspace*{20 mm} \}\\
\hspace*{10 mm} \}
}
\begin{thm}This program must loop infinitely on all inputs.\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
By contradiction. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists some string $w$ that causes the program to terminate. If the program terminates, it must accept or reject $w$. 

In the case that the program accepts the input $w$, it satisfies the conditional {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont if (willAccept (me, input))} and will thus {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont reject()}. This is a contradiction, because the method {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont willAccept()} returns true when the program in fact rejects the input.

Alternatively, in the case that the program rejects the input $w$, it does not satisfy the conditional and is punted to the {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont else} case, and the program will {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont accept()}. This is a contradiction, because the method {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont willAccept()} returns false, whereas the program accepts the input.

Both cases lead to a contradiction, so our assumption must be false. There must not exist a string $w$ that causes the program to terminate, which means that the program loops infinitely on all inputs.
